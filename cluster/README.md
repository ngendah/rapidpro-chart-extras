## Provision a local RapidPro cluster with k3d and docker compose

### Pre-requisites:

- [k3d](https://k3d.io/)

- [Docker and docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

- jq

    For most linux distro its available on the distro package repositories.

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)

### Steps:

1. Create a local cluster:

    ```sh 
      run.sh
   ````

    Options:

    - `install` : This will install on the local host the container registry self-signed certificate.

    - `stop` : This will stop and delete the cluster.

    e.g. To run the cluster:

    ```sh
        ./run.sh install
    ```

    Installation results:

    a. A 3 node Kubernetes cluster

    b. A Postgresql server

    c. A container registry

    d. Configurations:

   - For the container registry they are located on the directory `registry.conf.d`

   - For the postgres server they are located on the directory `postgresql.conf.d`

2. Login to the container registry

    The directory `registry.conf.d` will contain;
    a. username,
    b. password and 
    c. the container registry host ip.

    Using this details login to the registry;

    ```sh
        docker login --username <name> <container-registry-ip>
    ```

With this setup, you can now easily

1. Build and push the images

2. Deploy the RapidPro helm charts
